################### Errlogbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Errlogbeat ######################################

errlogbeat:
  # The registry_file defines where Errlogbeat persists its state.
  # This defaults to .errlogbeat.yml in the current working directory.
  #registry_file: .errlogbeat.yml

  # The checkpoint_max_updates defines the maximum number of published
  # events before persisting the state to disk. It defaults to 10.
  #checkpoint_max_updates: 10

  # The checkpoint_interval defines the maimum time before
  # persisting the state to disk. It defaults to 15s.
  #checkpoint_interval: 15s

  # The polling_interval defines how often Errlogbeat searches for new
  # entries if it is not triggered by SIGUSR1. This defaults to 15s.
  #polling_interval: 15s

  # By default Errlogbeat will keep running and waiting for new entries.
  # If once is set to true, it will exit after the last entry found.
  # Ensure that wait_close is set high enough for the events to be
  # transmitted when setting this to true.
  #once: false

  # wait_close sets the maximum duration to block on shutdown when
  # events cannot be published. It defaults to 15s.
  #wait_close: 15s
